        <p>
            The Bennett Event Registration Portal is a modern, responsive and beginner-friendly
            web application designed to make event participation easier for students.
            It displays upcoming university events with colorful cards, images and short
            descriptions to help users explore events quickly.
        </p>

        <p>
            The portal includes a premium registration page built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            and PHP. All submitted user details are securely stored inside an OpenOffice
            Spreadsheet file (.ods), eliminating the need for MySQL or any database setup.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project demonstrates clean front-end design, smooth UI interaction, and
            simple backend integration — making it a perfect academic mini-project as well
            as a practical registration solution for university events.
