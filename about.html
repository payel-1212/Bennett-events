        <h1>About This Project</h1>
               <p>
                The Bennett Event Portal is a modern and responsive web application built to simplify event discovery
                and registration for students at Bennett University. The main goal of this project is to create a clean,
                user-friendly platform where students can explore upcoming events and register quickly without needing
                any backend system or database setup.
                <br>
                The portal contains three key sections — Home, About, and Registration — each designed with clarity and
                smooth navigation in mind.
                The Home page highlights the major university events through attractive event cards, high-quality
                images, and short descriptions that help visitors understand what each event offers. Events such as
                Christmas 2025, Uphoria 2026, DJ Night, and Halloween reflect the diverse cultural and festive spirit of
                campus life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each event card is designed to be visually engaging, giving students a preview of what to expect:
                <br>
                Christmas 2025 – A festival of joy, music, celebration, and togetherness.
            <br>
                Uphoria 2026 – Bennett’s biggest cultural fest filled with performances, competitions, and energetic
                student participation.
            <br>    
                DJ Night 2026 – A high-energy evening featuring lights, EDM, and a lively crowd.
            <br>    
                Halloween 2026 – A spooky and fun event filled with costumes, themed activities, and entertainment.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Registration page allows students to sign up for any event through a simple form. Instead of using
                traditional backend technologies, this project uses pure JavaScript along with the SheetDB API, which
                sends the form data directly to a connected Google Spreadsheet. This approach removes the need for PHP,
                servers, or SQL databases, making the project lightweight, easy to deploy, and perfect for academic use.
                <br>
                The portal is fully responsive, ensuring that every component — from the hero section to event cards —
                adjusts beautifully across all screen sizes. The layout, animations, and glass-like effects contribute
                to a smooth and modern user experience suitable for real-world college event management.
                <br>
                Overall, this project demonstrates the practical use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON APIs, while
                showcasing creativity, UI design skills, and functional problem-solving. It serves as both a useful
                event registration system and an impressive academic mini-project. </p>
